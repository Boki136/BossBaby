<h2>Learning Reflection</h2>
<hr>
<br>


<p>
I came to this course with the previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I intended to improve my current skill and learn about the new ways of using those languages.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>First few sessions of the course were straight forward for me. I enjoyed the first session and all the theory about the internet and languages we are going to be using. The next thing we were learning was how to write HTML elements and what they mean and how to structure our website correctly.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Afterwards, we started introducing CSS to our code. We explored different ways of using CSS, which are inline, external & internal CSS.
We figured the best practice is to use the external stylesheet to avoid confusion and priority issues going forward.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>As we were learning about HTML and CSS, I was able to take a step back and focus more on theory and get a clearer understanding of what the code does rather than how to write it. The home exercises helped me a lot to improve my coding skills and efficiency of writing code.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I have explored some new ways on how to structure the specific parts of the page and how to manipulate them. For example, giving an element a width and centering it with margin: auto helped me a lot, so I can avoid using margin or padding. This technique allows us to write less code and make responsive websites easier.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  I liked the class when we discussed floats as I did not understand them before and was using different techniques which required me to write more code than necessary.
  <br>
  In-class CA exercise was a very lovely experience for me. I did put a little bit of pressure on me as we only had 3 hours to code up a website that was given to us in Photoshop, but I proved to myself how efficient I could be with the code and it gave me confidence going forward.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The last thing we went through was JavaScript. I was very excited about that part of the course as I do not have as much experience with it. Unfortunately, we only dedicated the last 2 hours of or session to it, and I was not able to learn any new techniques. It was nice to give a little bit of taste of JavaScript to the rest of the class so they can see how does the language that powers web operates.
<br>
The last part of our final exam was fun. I took the prototype that I built in UX class and started to code the character website from scratch. There was a good few challenge as I was trying to go above and beyond with website functionality and responsiveness, but I’m thrilled with the outcome.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>Overall, I had a pleasant experience in this course. It gave me a push that I needed to become a good developer and to keep shaping my skills. I’m more confident now that I want to choose this career path as I’m really enjoying every second of it.</p>
